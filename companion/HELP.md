# companion-module-syncer-live

This module can be used to remotely hide and show instances of [syncer.live](https://syncer.live).

To use the module set the remote group id when creating your syncer. Then set your buttons to the same group id.

It's recommended to create a feedback with the same group id to show the current state of the syncer.
